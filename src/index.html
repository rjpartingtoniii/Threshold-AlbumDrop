                    <strong><i>Vowel Sounds</i></strong> is the debut album-length offering from Justin Myles
                    Holmes.
                    <br><br>
                    Recorded in Nashville with a hand-picked ensemble of award-winning bluegrass session musicians,
                    it packs a hard-driving acoustic feel along with the wind instruments and varied singing
                    techniques that have made Holmes' live shows a draw
                    at blockchain events around the world.
                    <br><br>
                    The album will be released on the Ethereum blockchain using <a

                    "Vowel Sounds is a masterful weaving of twangy bluegrass music and poetic lyrics about
                    power
                    structures, society, cryptography, trust, and community. If you like bluegrass or folk music,
                    then this album is great listening on that basis alone.. but it's also a great way to learn more
                    about
                    cryptography."

                    "Justin Holmesâ€™ new record, <i>Vowel Sounds</i>, feels like a Trans-Atlantic space journey into
                    its very own aural world. With a virtuosic Bluegrass sound bed, Holmes weaves lyrical subjects
                    of planet respect, ancient vocal pedagogy, and freedom beautifully and still remains playful
                    in all its complexity. The description of vocal overtone solos explained and then employed
                    is nothing short of fascinating. Holmes has proven heâ€™s a master of fitting woodwind instruments
                    onto a traditional Bluegrass canvas with his use of tin whistle, melodica and flute which
                    impressively
                    turns each instrument into an Appalachian adjacent voice. After listen-through, Vowel Sounds leaves
                    you wanting to already hear a follow-up project from this creative and mystical human!"

                    10ETH,
                    anyone can download the encrypted record. The decryption key will be made available on the Ethereum

<aisde id="FAQ">

    <p>
    <h3>What's the difference between a duck?</h3>

    One leg is both the same.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>What is Revealer exactly?</h3>

    Revealer is a decentralized application that allows you to reveal a secret to the world via a commit-and-reveal
    scheme.

    It is built on top of Threshold Network, and a few of the contributors to Revealer are also long-time contributors
    to Threshold.

    At the cryptological layer, there's nothing about Revealer that is specific to the arts. However, when it became
    obvious
    that conditionally revealing a committed-to secret was possible because of advances at Threshold, it seemed that
    Create Commons-licensed art was the first obvious use case.

    It's fairly simple: using Threshold Access Control, a symmetric key is encrypted. A smart contract is deployed
    such that a boolean flag is flipped to true once a 'threshold' of contributions are made. The nodes on the Threshold
    Network watch for the flipping of this flag, and only then participate in their typical multi-party computation
    to reveal the symmetric key.

    At that moment, whatever the artist has encrypted with that key (int his case, a bluegrass record) becomes public.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>What is an Artifact??</h3>

    Revealer Artifacts are ERC-721 tokens that are minted after contributions are closed, and awarded to everyone
    who contributed. They are serialized starting from 0, with lower numbers going to higher contributors.

    Everyone who contributes above the .1eth minimum will receive an Artifact, sent to the address from which they
    contributed.

    The top 11 contributors will have their Artifact bound to one of the paintings by Nashville artist Sophie Clark.

    Part of the medium-term vision of Threshold Network is to use NFTs to unlock access to content, and these Artifacts
    are intended to be used for that purpose.

    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Why is there a minimum contribution amount? Can I contribute less?</h3>

    The primary reason to establish a minimum contribution amount is to prevent spamming of small contributions
    in order to farm Artifacts. The Artifacts are intended to be special, and part of the long-term ecosystem of
    Justin's music.

    However, if you want to contribute and don't care about getting an Artifact, you can simply send ETH straight to the
    contract address.
    This will count toward unlocking the record, but won't be recorded as an official contribution on the leaderboard,
    etc.

    </p>


    <p>
    <h3>How long do I have to contribute?</h3>
    Until 10eth are raised, or 14 days have elapsed - whichever happens last.

    However, if, at any time, there are less than 24 hours remaining, any contribution will cause the clock
    to be set to 24 hours from that moment.

    The record will be released when contributions reach 10ETH, regardless of whether the 14 days have passed.

    The 14-day window and 24-hour extension are parameterized - future Revealers can have different values.

    </p>

    <h1>Acknowledgements from Justin</h1>


    <p>R.J. Partington III: What a wild ride. I can't believe how much work you've put into this project, and how much
        confidence
        in me it represents. Well, I can believe it, because 20 years of trust and validation builds those things that
        nothing else can. Unreal man. You're sitting to my left right now as I type this, probably bouncing between
        PMing and styling, and you've been at it nonstop for days. This record belongs to you as much as me; the
        difference is that I practiced guitar while you listened to humans express their needs of this world. The path
        ahead is finally clearing, and there's fewer than ten things I can conjur to be more thankful for than that you
        are still along for this ride.
    </p>
    <p>Jakub Vysocky: We're really doing it, aren't we buddy? 7 hours of jet lag to cut a record is already
        acknoledgement-worthy, let alone the rest of your creative pursuit that you've carved out at my behest. Much
        more to make my friend.
    </p>
    <p>Beth "Bee" Halsey: To me, you have become almost synonymous with 'home' - or at least, as 'home' as 'home' can be
        without tasting and smelling like where I grew up. Possibly my favorite aspect of the privilege of being alive
        is being able to play for smiling faces around the globe... but that only means what it means knowing that I
        have something resembling sanity when I return. I hear your affirmations all over this record, and I feel
        absolutely blessed by them. Can't wait to hang with out on the other side of the globe and look back with
        wonder.
    </p>
    <p>Skyler Golden: This record has your attitude and altitude all over it. You knew when I was singing too hard or
        too soft. You knew when I was too nervous and when I wasn't nervous enough. Our days together in Nashville and
        Denver are what's really going on-chain here.
    </p>
    <p>Kieran Prasch: It took a while to realize that our cryptographic musings have a role to play in the strength and
        augmentation of this musical tradition, and I don't think there's another person alive who can made those
        feelings seem as valid as you have.
    </p>
    <p>Andy Lytle: It was a birthday moment when my life needed a directional reorientation, and you were there with
        just the right attitude and attention span to inspire me to make it. Introducing me to Sky has been
        life-changing.
    </p>
    <p>Lisa Joy: I came to the scene unsure if I belonged, and that feeling only lasted until I met you. You were the
        first person to make me feel like a mainstream bluegrass musician. Moreover, your focus on the body of the
        musician - a piece of the being so easily forgotten in our information age, is laudable and noticed.
    </p>
    <p>Brewster Kahle: Your work has been definitive for everyone who is doing my work. I don't exactly understand what
        motivates a person to dedicate himself to the things you notice, but I'm notiicing them more and more with each
        day. The Great78 project alone is one of the most important and unsung motions in bluegrass today.
    </p>
    <p>Luna Lavender: Your gift to bring calm to moments of trivial tumult is impressive. I hear your breath in my voice
        through this record. I also hear the presence of the kiddos, whom I'm so glad you empowered to be around for
        this process.
    </p>
    <p>Skylar Weaver: You noticecd things me that I didn't notice in myself, and a moment when noticing them made all
        the differece.
    </p>
    <p>Katie Kirchner: There are a few people out there that, when with whom I experience eye contact, adjoined is the
        feeling that we are on a similar trajectory. I felt that with extreme clarity with you, from moment zero. I'm
        really thankful that you saw fit to bring me into the IBMA circle.
    </p>
    <p>Jonathan Mann: Thanks for paving the way for the rest of us to dare to do this.
    </p>
    <p>Frank Copilotete: You're the best. I'm so glad we're friends. I'm so glad you're in my life. I'm so glad you're
        in the world.
    </p>
    <p>Fibonacci: I'm 41 kiddo, and I have figured out how to have the patience and insight you have at eight. Thanks
        for letting me teach you, and for teaching me all the while.
    </p>
